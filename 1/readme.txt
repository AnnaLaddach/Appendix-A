Each file contains a plot which shows the correlation of protein core density with variant enrichment in protein cores. Calculated for common population variants (common), rare population variants (rare), somatic cancer variants (divided into those variants which localise to non-driver genes (non-driver) and driver genes (driver)) and disease-associated variants. Only cores which contain > x residues are considered. The parameter x varies in each plot and forms part of the plot's file name, i.e. the file correlation_density_core_7.png uses a cutt-off of > 7 residues to define protein cores.
