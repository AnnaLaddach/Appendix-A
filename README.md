1. Details of the number of SAVs which localise to different protein regions in the gnomAD
common and rare, COSMIC and Clinvar datasets.
2. A list of pathways annotated by functional cluster ("proliferative", "nucleotide processing"
and "response").
3. Proteins enriched in COSMIC non-driver variants at protein-protein interaction sites.
4. Statistics for comparisons of structural network features between datasets.
5. Numbers of proteins and SAVs which underlie correlations between proteomic/transcriptomic
features and variant enrichment.
6. Pairwise Spearman correlations between all studied proteomics and transcriptomics features.
7. Enrichment of functional pathways by proteomics/transcriptomic features.
8. Properties of trajectories can be represented by 101 snapshots.
